Much has been written and researched about this topic throughout the past century.  You likely have heard a lot of \"conventional lineup wisdom\" which suggests various rules of thumb, such as placing the fastest hitter as the leadoff man (1st), the best power hitter as the cleanup hitter (4th), or the highest average hitter in the 3rd spot.\n\n")
    fp.write('\tThe bad news is that the "conventional lineup wisdom" of old is based largely on "gut feelings", which do not necessarily result in winning lineup combinations.  While conventional wisdom may be smart to follow loosely, it is perhaps easy to see that monolithic advice such as "place the highest average hitter in the 3rd spot" without considering other variables such as the composition of the rest of the lineup is a sub-optimal lineup-building approach.  The good news is that you, as the manager, need not follow outdated, data-blind rules when setting your lineup-- instead, by following the lineup suggestions in this report, you can construct a lineup to be as close to optimal as possible.\n\n')
    fp.write('\tI am well aware that the batting order is not constructed in a vacuum-- that is, you as a manager have player egos to manage and as such will be "forced" through external, social factors to bat certain players at certain positions.  This is why this report offers, in addition to the five most optimal lineup combinations, a detailed analysis of which positions a player should bat to optimize lineup performance.  Thus, you as a manager will be able to make an informed decision balancing the various pressures of managing a clubhouse with constructing a lineup that offers the maximum number of runs per game.\n\n')
    fp.write('\tOur data driven approach will simulate full 162-game seasons of baseball using a baseball simulation engine.  Seasons will be simulated using different permutations of a 9-person batting lineup, and the runs/game from each season will be recorded, processed, and evaluated to find 1) optimal batting positions for each player and 2) the top 5 optimal lineups.  Player historical statistics will be used as an input as an estimate of future performance-- that is, our report generates optimal lineup data assuming that players will play to their previously statistical ability.  However, if you suspect a player\'s abilities have significantly deviated from their historical performance, it would be easy to add these new observations by altering the statistical data contained in the input csv files to our simulation engine (or ask your resident computer/data science professional to change these values for you).\n\n')
    fp.write('\tIf you are short on time, below are 5 of the optimal lineups based on maximizing runs/game that appeared in our simulations.  In addition to runs/game data, we have also included the statistical output of each player during that season, which should give you a sense of how each player fared in our simulated season.  This data is included because the variance in baseball, even in a 162-game season, can be admittedly high-- thus, if you notice that a player over-performed or under-performed in the season in question, you can adjust your lineup evaluations accordingly.  Regardless, using one of these lineup combinations in real MLB games should allow for a relatively optimal performance.\n\n')
